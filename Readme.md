🌍 World Economic Report

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to create a one-page report that highlights key insights on the state of the global economy using World Bank Economic Analysis data. The final output is an infographic-style report showcasing major trends in global economic growth and development.

📊 Data Sources

World Economic Indicators:
The World Bank funds infrastructure projects in the developing world. As part of its mission, it releases an annual report on economic indicators. This dataset includes important indicators of economic performance and development from 1960-2018, including fields like electricity consumption, GDP per capita, life expectancy, and more.

To augment the World Bank data, Human Development Index (HDI) data has been provided by the United Nations (UN). HDI is a composite measure of how developed a country is based on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and educational attainment. This supplementary dataset contains additional indicators used by the UN to track development, environmental impact, and inequality for each country from 1990-2021.

🎯 Objectives

Data Quality & Profiling: QA and profile the World Bank data, integrating additional UN datasets.

Data Preparation: Clean, transform, and reformat data for visualization.

Visualization Development: Generate visual representations of key economic trends.

Final Report: Combine visualizations into a single infographic-style report.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
